OSMDownloader
=============

This is just a quick and dirty hack that iterates over a (currently hard-coded) kmz file, and is ment to download all the OSM tiles along all the LineStrings and Points in it. Currently between zoom 9 and 15, it does not download, but only counts the number of different tiles. Do not hook up the download, as at this bulk it might slow down OSM tile servers!
